Welcome to... Hmmstagram ðŸ¤”

This is an Instagram-like React project; users can look at, comment on, like, and create posts. Posts are randomly generated using data from two different APIs - I don't quite trust users to upload their own photos yet! ðŸ˜…

NOTE: Users can only generate a post once per session (for now). While this isn't ideal, I neither want to kill the APIs nor my own database. Thank you for understanding!
