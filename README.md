Welcome to... Hmmstagram 🤔

This is an Instagram-like project; users can look at, comment on, like, and create posts. Posts are randomly generated using data from two different APIs - I don't quite trust users to upload their own photos yet! 😅

Top priority: BUG --- If the user has liked at least 1 post, generating a new post will cause the FIRST liked post to no longer count as liked (but the number of likes will still be correct). I am, like, working on it 💁🏻‍♂️

NOTE: Users can only generate a post once per session (for now). While this isn't ideal, I neither want to kill the APIs nor my own database. Thank you for understanding!
