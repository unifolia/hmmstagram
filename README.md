Welcome to... Hmmstagram 🤔

This is an Instagram-like project; users can look at, comment on, like, and create posts. Posts are randomly generated using data from two different APIs - I don't quite trust users to upload their own photos yet! 😅

!! Top priorities !!
Bugs. There are a few bugs here and there. 🐛 Most notably, the user's first "like" will disappear on post generation. e.g. - if you were to "like" five photos and then generate a post, the first of your five "likes" would disappear into the ether.

NOTE: Users can only generate a post once per session (for now). While this isn't ideal, I neither want to kill the APIs nor my own database. Thank you for understanding!
