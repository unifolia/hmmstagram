Welcome to... Hmmstagram 🤔

This is an Instagram-like project; users can look at, comment on, like, and create posts. Posts are randomly generated using data from two different APIs - I don't quite trust users to upload their own photos yet! 😅

!! Top priorities !!
1. Great UX for all devices. This app was developed using a "mobile first" approach, so the desktop version - while fine - leaves a bit to be desired. 🖥
2. Bugs. There are a few bugs here and there. 🐛 Most notably, the user's first "like" will disappear on post generation. I.e. - if you were to "like" five photos and then generate a post, the first of your five "likes" would disappear into the ether.
